Issue 41: Calculate biomass of shrubs
================

Here I wrap discussions in issue 41 and try to come up with my next
actions for developing code.

  - Where is Valentineâ€™s code again?

  - Write expressive conditions to use in if statements to control flow:
    
      - `is_shrub()`.
      - `depends_on_dbh()`.
      - `depends_on_dba()`.
