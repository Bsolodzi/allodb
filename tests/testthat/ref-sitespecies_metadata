7  Allometric equation category that can be selected by the user. "Generic" equations are the current best equations or equation groups that can be applied to any site in a broad geographic area (e.g., pantropical, continental) and to any taxa at that site. "Expert" equations are the current best equations for specific taxa at a specific site, as identified by a botanist or forest ecologist. "Other" equations are potentially relevant (i.e., may be selected as best under different criteria) or were previously classified as best available.
