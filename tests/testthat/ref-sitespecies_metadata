7  Allometric equation group that can be selected by the user. "Generic" equations are the current best equations or equation groups that can be applied to any site in a broad geographic area (e.g., pantropical, continental) and to any taxa at that site. "Expert selected" equations are the current best equations for specific taxa at a specific site, as identified by a botanist or forest ecologist. "Other" equations are potentially relevant (i.e., may be selected as best under different criteria) or were previously classified as best available, but not currently classified as best available.
