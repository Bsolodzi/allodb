5 / E,life_form,Common growth form for a given plant species,character,NA,NA,NA,NA
6 / F,dependent_variable_biomass_component,Tree component characterized by the equation,character,-,-,-,NA
7 / G,equation_group,"Allometric equation group that can be selected by the user. ""Generic"" equations are the current best equations or equation groups that can be applied to any site in a broad geographic area (e.g., pantropical, continental) and to any taxa at that site. ""Expert selected"" equations are the current best equations for specific taxa at a specific site, as identified by a botanist or forest ecologist. ""Other"" equations are potentially relevant (i.e., may be selected as best under different criteria) or were previously classified as best available.",character,G- generic; E- expert selected; O- other,-,-,its likely that we'll want a grouping variable like this for wood density
