6 / F,equation_group,"Allometric equation category that can be selected by the user. ""Generic"" equations are the current best equations that can be applied to any site in a broad geographic area (e.g., pantropical, temperate) and to any taxa at that site. ""Expert"" equations are the current best equations for specific taxa at a specific site, as identified by a botanist or forest ecologist.
