Is this to delete?
================

This folder (is\_this\_to\_delete/) contains data (and helpfiles) that
was previously exported but may be useless. These are the names of the
likely useless datasets: \* WSG \* ficus \* site.info \* wsg\_ctfs3 \*
allo\_temperate

Erika, I think you donâ€™t need these files anymore. Please confirm:

  - Should I remove all of these?
  - If not all, Which ones should I remove?
