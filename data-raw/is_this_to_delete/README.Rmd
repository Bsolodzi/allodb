title: "Is this to delete?"
output: github_document

This folder (is_this_to_delete/) contains data (and helpfiles) that was previously exported but may be useless. These are the names of the likely useless datasets:
* WSG
* ficus
* site.info
* wsg_ctfs3
* allo_temperate

Erika, I think you don't need these files anymore. Please confirm:

* Should I remove all of these?
* If not all, Which ones should I remove?
