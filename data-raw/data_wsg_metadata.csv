1 / A,wsg_id,Wood specific gravity unique identification number,numeric,-,-,,
2 / B,family,Plant family name as Taxonomic Name Resolution Services an online free tool for correcting and standardizing plant names.,character,,,,
3 / C,genus,Plant genus name as Taxonomic Name Resolution Services an online free tool for correcting and standardizing plant names.,character,,,,
4 / D,species,Plant species name as Taxonomic Name Resolution Services an online free tool for correcting and standardizing plant names.,character,,,,
5 / E,wsg,Wood specific gravity,numeric,,g/cm3,-,
6 / F,wsg_specificity,"Specific taxonomic level for which the wsg was measured (species, genus, family or plant group)",character,-,-,-,"from KAT: this field may not be necessary. For example, we could indicate a genus level by recording ""spp"" or ""multiple"" in species field."
7 / G,sample_size,"Number of trees sampled to estimate wood specific gravity (from original publication, same as allometry model)",numeric,,,,"This will be almost imposible to gather, considering the amount species in the network"
8 / H,site,ForestGEO site name,character,,,,"Species could be present in more than one site (specially in North America). I am not sure how to handle that.  | from KAT: there can be multiple records for a single species, which will differ in wsg_id, wsg, site, n_tree, ref_id."
9 / I,ref_id,Unique reference identification number to our data source. Links to multiple tables.,numeric,,,,
