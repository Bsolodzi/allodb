1 / A,equation_id,Unique equation identification number given arbitrarely. Links to Site_Species table. ,-,-,-,-,
2 / B,biomass_variable,Tree component characterized by the equation ,character (string),-,-,-,
3 / C,equation_form,Model equation as a function of DBH or DBA,character (string),-,-,-,We currently have equation form and parameters listed separately. We willl need a script to transform these. Mauro could write a scrip to merge
4 / D,allometry_specificity,"Refers to the specific taxonomic level for which the equation was developed (species, genus, family or plant group)",character (string),-,-,-,
5 / E,development_species,Species for which the particular equation was developed,character (string),,,,
6 / F,geographic_area,Geographic location from which trees were sampled to develop the original equation ,character (string),-,-,-,
7 / G,dbh_min_cm,Minimun DBH in cm sampled to develop the equation,numeric,-,,-,
8 / H,dbh_max_cm,Maximun DBH in cm sampled to develop the equation,numeric,-,,-,
9 / I,n_trees,Number of trees sampled to develop the equation,numeric,-,-,-,
10 / J,dbh_unit_original,DBH unit used in original publication,,,,,
11 / K,biomass_unit_original,Mass unit used in original publication,character (string),-,,-,
12 / L,allometry_development_method,"Method used to develop the allometry. Traditionally, this is done by harvesting whole trees, drying, and weighing (""harvest"").  However, we anticipate that many future allometries will be developed using ground-based LiDAR (""lidar"").",character (string),see description,-,-,
13 / M,model_parameters,Parameters included in model (H: tree height (m); DBH: diameter breast heigh (1.3 m); DBA: diameter at base; WD: wood density),,,,,"EGA: We may excude this column later, but lets leave it for now."
14 / N,regression_model,Regression model used in original publication,,,,,
15 / O,other_equations_tested,,,,,,
16 / P,log_biomass,Whether the fits are done with biomass as the response variable log(biomass). ,character (string),Yes -logaritmic transformation (base 10) was used; No - no log used,,,
17 / Q,bias_corrected,Indicates if a correction factor (CF) or a relative standard error (RSE) was included in model,numeric,0- false; 1- true,-,-,
18 / R,bias_correction_factor,"Correction factor for the specific equation, pulled from original publication, if included",numeric,-,-,-,
19 / S,notes_fitting model,Other details in statistical methods,,,,,
20 / T,data_availability,Indicate whether or not the original source data is available,,0- false; 1- true,-,,
21 / U,ref_id,Unique reference identification number for biomass equation source. Links to Reference table.,-,-,-,-,
22 / V,warning,Warning or error message to indicate any pitfall that could spoil the AGB estimate based on equation selected ,,,,,
