Column,Field,Description,Alphanumeric attributes/ storage type (present data values),Variable codes,Units,Range,Erikas notes to delete before publication
1 / A,equation_id,Unique equation identification number given arbitrarely. Links to Site_Species table. ,-,-,-,-,
2 / B,variable,Biomass component characterized by the equation ,character (string),-,-,-,
3 / C,equation,Model equation as a function of DBH or DBA,-,-,-,-,We currently have equation form and parameters listed separately. We’ll need a script to transform these. Mauro could write a scrip to merge
4 / D,taxa,"Refers to the specific taxonomic level for which the equation was developed (species, genus, family or plant group)",character (string),-,-,-,
5 / E,development_species,Refers to the species for which the allometry was developed,,,,,
6 / F,geographic_area,Geographic location from which trees were sampled to develop the original equation ,character (string),-,-,-,
7 / G,dbh_min,Minimun DBH sampled to develop the  equation,numeric,-,,-,
8 / H,dbh_max,Maximun DBH sampled to develop the equation,numeric,-,,-,
9 / I,n_trees,N trees sampled to develop the equation,numeric,-,-,- ,I didn’t pull this at the beginning so I think we can omit unless we absolutely need to publish this value here…
10 / J,biomass_unit,Mass unit used in original publication,character (string),-,,-,
