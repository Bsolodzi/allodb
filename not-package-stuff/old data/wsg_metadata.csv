6 / F,wsg_specificity,"Specific taxonomic level for which the wsg was measured (species, genus, family or plant group)",character,-,-,-,"from KAT: this field may not be necessary. For example, we could indicate a genus level by recording ""spp"" or ""multiple"" in species field."
7 / G,sample_size,"Number of trees sampled to estimate wood specific gravity (from original publication, same as allometry model)",numeric,NA,NA,NA,"This will be almost imposible to gather, considering the amount species in the network"
8 / H,site,ForestGEO site name,character,NA,NA,NA,"Species could be present in more than one site (specially in North America). I am not sure how to handle that.  | from KAT: there can be multiple records for a single species, which will differ in wsg_id, wsg, site, n_tree, ref_id."
