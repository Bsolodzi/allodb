For validation data (destructive measurements) we used a subset from hte original dataset with available DBH (> 1cm), H (m) and AGB (kg)


Filter original data by: Pabo, dbh, ht. Add a column called "Genus". 
Pabo= Above-ground biomass, kg oven dry matter

Ignore warnings when reading data from xls file

In total we are using 6266 trees, 85 species, 176 sites (filter by location)

In case we need more data to validate our predicted values we can use (but we will need to add all 
dry-componets to obtain AGB based on dry-matter AND need to add latin names):

File= 2-Validation data
Distribution: Canada
