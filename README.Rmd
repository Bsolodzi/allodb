# allodb: A database of allometric equations for ForestGEO

The goal of allodb is to develop, host and give access to tables of allometric equations for ForestGEO's network.

It is based on Chave et al 2014 allometric models and some modified functions of the BIOMASS package. It computes biomass after having allocated wood density. The wood density database arise from CTFS and, I guess, isn't aimed to be shared publicly.

## Setup

Make data manipulation and visualization easier

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# Print only few rows of dataframes to save space and time
options(dplyr.print_min = 3, dplyr.print_max = 3)
```


Load data objects and functions in __allodb__ (from Ervan)

```{r}
library(allodb)
```

## Explore data

```{r}
glimpse(ficus)
```

```{r}
glimpse(site.info)
```

```{r}
glimpse(WSG)
```

I'm particularly interested in these data. Can we add a variable `equation` -- relating dbh with biomass based on `wsg` and `E`?

```{r}
left_join(site.info, WSG) %>% 
  select(site, genus, species, wsg, E)
```

## Explore code

Ervan, could you show some examples of how your funcitons work?

Go to [function's help files](https://forestgeo.github.io/allodb/reference/index.html)

## Installation

You can install allodb from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token # with a token from
# https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the repo # scope.

# install.packages("devtools")

# Install the master branch
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/allodb", auth_token = "abc")

# Install an ISSUE-specific branch with
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/allodb@ISSUE", auth_token = "abc")

# Then, load each time before using
library(allodb)
```
