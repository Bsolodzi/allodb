# Overview

This report provides key information for meeting with Ervan, Krista and Erika about compiling allometric equation for ForestGEO sites.

## Meeting goals:

1. Both for tropical and temperate forests, compile tables with variables `<category>` (e.g. `site`) and `equation` (`<category>` should be, at this first stage, a variable for which getting allometric equations is relatively quick);

2. Clarify what can/cannot be shared and discuss alternatives.

3. Other's goals

# Background

[@](https://goo.gl/sxjHir)


## Tropical forests

* site-level allometries are possible; the table below seems to have sufficient data for developing a table with variables `site` and `equation`:

```
# Source: Ervan

#>        site   genus     species   wsg       E
#>       <chr>   <chr>       <chr> <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 amacayacu Abarema barbouriana 0.567 -0.0793
#> 2 amacayacu Abarema     jupunba 0.585 -0.0793
#> 3 amacayacu   Abuta grandifolia 0.450 -0.0793
#> # ... with 8,597 more rows
```

* genus-level allometries are possible

> generic allometric models are ... widely used.

--Ervan

* species-level allometries are not possible

> ... tropical forests are way too diverse to even think about developing specific allometric models (Rutishauser et al. 2013).

--Ervan

## Temperate forests:

* taxa-level allometries are possible

> we’re compiling taxa-specific allometries (locally developed when possible)

-- Krista

# What we have

## Tropical forests

Ervan provided useful tables and code.

![](https://i.imgur.com/O9rt33U.png)

These data seems to be what I need. Can we add a variable `equation` -- relating dbh with biomass based on `wsg` and `E`?

```
left_join(allodb::site.info, allodb::WSG) %>% 
  select(site, genus, species, wsg, E)
#> Joining, by = "site"
#> Warning: Column `site` joining factor and character vector, coercing into
#> character vector
#> # A tibble: 8,600 x 5

#>        site   genus     species   wsg       E
#>       <chr>   <chr>       <chr> <dbl>   <dbl>
#> 1 amacayacu Abarema barbouriana 0.567 -0.0793
#> 2 amacayacu Abarema     jupunba 0.585 -0.0793
#> 3 amacayacu   Abuta grandifolia 0.450 -0.0793
#> # ... with 8,597 more rows
```

The code seems mature. I think it'd be great to share it. It only seems to need minor edits, some examples, and a bit more documentation. The function's help files are [here](https://forestgeo.github.io/allodb/reference/index.html).

## Temperate forests

> I can share with you the allometry table I showed you (one equation per species/per site).

-- Erika









> there are (...) "generic" (1) models for [Europe and Northern China]. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any generic (2) allometric model for temperate zones.

-- Ervan

Ervan, Am I right in thinking that in (1) you mean _general_ and in (2) you mean _taxonomic-genus-level_?

# Privacy of wood density data

Please discuss what can and cannot be shared and how to do it.


> The wood density database arise from CTFS and, I guess, isn't aimed to be shared publicly.

-- Ervan

(Ervan, are you saying that what can't be shared is your table `WSG`?)

> my initial thought is that the package needs to be open access, and therefore may need to rely on some other source for wood density when the data is not public.

-- Krista

# Supplementary notes

## Let users input customize the allometric equations

> I assume that most PI are using there own "locally" developed allometric model, or could do so using trees harvested in the surrounding area. It's a bit of work, but we could provide assistance here too.

-- Ervan

> We (...) need a mechanism by which users can include data that’s not public.

--Krista

# Notes from the meeting itself

## Tropical Forests

* Making a table of `site` and `equaiton` -- based on `E` and `wood-density` -- is possible. Currently, such equaiton is in Ervan's code. Example from `comp.AGB()`:

```r
# more code

AGB <- (0.0673 * (WD * H * (D/10)^2)^0.976)/1000

# more code

		E <- site.info$E[INDEX]
		AGB <- exp(-2.023977 - 0.89563505 * E + 0.92023559 *
				log(WD) + 2.79495823 * log(D/10) - 0.04606298 *
				(log(D/10)^2))/1000

# more code
```

* Ervan suggests that the `biomass()` function needs a parameter to input wood density because new wood density data becomes available frequently and users may want to incorporate it. That is why he prefers to compute biomass not with a fixed equation but as a function of wood density.

## Temperate forests

* Erika pushed her dataset Allometries_Temperate sites.xlsx. The format seems to be one I have been thinking about, with one variable giving `equation` and multiple variables giving categories -- such as site and several taxonomic-level categories.

* I'll study the table and try it with the code I have. Erika offerred to answer questions any time. But she will start her new contract in December 1st.

* Erika, Krista and I agreed to meet, at SCBI, some day during the first week of December.

* Ervan suggested that the most specific equations (i.e. closer geographically or of higher taxonomic resolution) not always may be _the best_ equaiton. Instead, best might be one _generic_ ecuation. [Here _generic_ means not "of taxonomic genus level"; it means _general_ -- an equation that has been produced based on measuring many trees]. He said that there are _generic_ equations for three reigons: North America, Europe and China. For each region there may be multiple equaitons: one per each taxonomical group.

* Those _generic_ equations seem to be a relatively easy first step. That is, I could use them to try and improve the prototype code I wrote.  Those equations may be tabled independently, or may be incorporated into Erika's table (some of those _generic_ equations already be in Erika's table, but we may need to check with Ervan that we are talking about the same equaitons).
