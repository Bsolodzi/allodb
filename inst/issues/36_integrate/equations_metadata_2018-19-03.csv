1 / A,equation_id,Unique equation identification number given arbitrarely. Links to Site_Species table.,-,-,-,-,NA
2 / B,biomass_component,Tree component characterized by the equation,character,-,-,-,NA
3 / C,equation,Model equation as a function of DBH or DBA,character,-,-,-,We currently have equation form and parameters listed separately. We willl need a script to transform these. Mauro could write a scrip to merge
4 / D,allometry_specificity,"Refers to the specific taxonomic level for which the equation was developed (species, genus, family or plant group)",character,-,-,-,NA
5 / E,development_species,Species for which the particular equation was developed,character,NA,NA,NA,NA
6 / F,geographic_area,Geographic location from which trees were sampled to develop the original equation,character,-,-,-,NA

12 / L,allometry_development_method,"Method used to develop the allometry. Traditionally, this is done by harvesting whole trees, drying, and weighing (""harvest"").  However, we anticipate that many future allometries will be developed using ground-based LiDAR (""lidar"").",character,see description,-,-,NA
