```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

equations <- read_csv(here("data-raw/csv_database/equations.csv"))
references <- read_csv(here("data-raw/csv_database/references.csv"))
```

Now, equations and references are linked by refid.

```{r}
left_join(equations, references)
```

This needs to be cleaned:

```{r}
unique(references$ref_id)
```

Actionable next steps:

* Erika, please check what's the meaning of "no in master table" and rename `refid` as `ref_id`.

* Also feel free to edit the values of `refid`. You may want to remove the separator "_". If you do edit `refid`, please remember to do it in both `equaitons` and `references`.

* Continue adding new reference-ids as you add new equations and references.
