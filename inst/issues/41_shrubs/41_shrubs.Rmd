Here I wrap discussions in issue 41 and try to come up with my next actions for developing code.

## Checks
* Err if multiple data contains multiple plots
* Err if stemid is duplicated
* Warn if multiple data contains multiple censuses.

## Computation

* If `is_shrub()` and `independent_variable == DBH`:
    * find main stem of each treeid.
    * evaluate `equation_allometry` only to dbh of main stem, and get `total_biomass`.
    * redistrubute biomass to each stem
        * contribution = dbh of each stem / sum of dbh of all stems of a treeid
        * `contribution * total_biomass`

* If `is_shrub()` and `independent_variable == DBA`
    * basal_area = sum of basal area by treeid.
    * dba aprox. sqrt(dbh1^2 + dbh2^2 + ...) (assuming area preserving).
    * apply equation to calculated dba and get `total_biomass`.
    * redistribute `total_biomass`
